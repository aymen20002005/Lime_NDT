# Lime_NDT

Lime_NDT is a Python library that introduces an enhanced version of the LIME technique for model explainability, leveraging Neural Decision Trees (NDTs) for improved local and global interpretability of machine learning models.

## Features

- Enhanced LIME explanations using Neural Decision Trees.
- Support for tabular data.
- Tools for extracting, analyzing, and comparing decision trees and forests.
- Utilities for submodular pick and discretization.
- Integration with Keras and scikit-learn.
